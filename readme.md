# Customer Churn Rate Analysis
## by Fares Ahmed


## Dataset

> A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers cancelling their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is going to get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction and that's what we are going to do getting a close look on each feature and its effect on the customers.

> This data was downloaded from kaggle.com and it seems like it was cleaned beforehand since there isn't a single NaN value nor a duplicate, url: 'https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers'


## Summary of Findings

> The goal behind the study is detecting trends that differentiate canceller accounts, there were some demographic variables and some other variables relating to the usage. Demographic ones held zero insights, however almost all of the usage features held statistical significance. 

> As for which features were insightful:
>> The number of times contacts the bank increases the chance of cancellation.

>> The number of months being inactive through the last year increases the chance of cancellation.

>> The number of transactions done through the last year where the lower bound area was more probable to be a canceller and the upper bound existing customers divided around the 57 transactions mark.

> There is a couple more features with statistical significance but these were the most notable.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> First I chose to view the distribution of the data and then start searching for insights, and since the features weren't that much insightful features so I showed most of them which are Months_Inactive_12_mon, Contacts_Count_12_mon and Total_Trans_Ct.
